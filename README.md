# soroban-wasmi

This is a fork of https://github.com/paritytech/wasmi with a small set of local
patches applied for customizing interaction with https://soroban.stellar.org 

It may be abandoned at some point if Soroban is able to meet its needs strictly
with upstream interfaces. The fork was for expedience during development.

Other projects should not use it, and should use upstream instead.

The Parity authors have been removed from the Cargo.toml metadata to avoid the
implication that this fork is their responsibility or action, and to emphasize
that users should not bother the Parity authors with support requests for this
crate.

This crate was still entirely (with the exception of a couple small patches)
written by Parity Technologies, and their copyright notices are maintained.
